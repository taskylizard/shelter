#features:
#  - title: Robustness
#    details: |
#        shelter is built to rely as little as possible on volatile components of Discord's internals.
#        It has already survived a major Discord tooling change essentially unscathed.
#  - title: No node requirement
#    details: |
#        shelter works entirely within the web, even on electron Discord. This means you do not have fragments of
#        shelter-related things all over your computer, and making it work in browsers is relatively easy.
#  - title: Developer Friendly
#    details: |
#        shelter has developer tooling included out of the box, including a hot-reload devmode using our own build tool,
#        useful (though unconventional) APIs, and above-average documentation for a client mod.
